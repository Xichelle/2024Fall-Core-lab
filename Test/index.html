            I know there's a good chance you won't notice me<br>
            and this could just be an accident. <br>
            What made you see me? The shiny, the beautiful. <br>
            Everyone passes by and doesn't think there's anything else here, <br>
            so I try to be honest here.<br>

            Curiosity led you to me? I guess so. <br>
            Who am I? <br>
            It's the person who sent these photos, <br>
            the person I want you to see in those photos and the person who is typing this, <br>
            someone so ordinary that you might not even remember disappearing into the crowd.<br>

            I go through the same routine day after day, <br>
            going to class, cooking, washing, completing daily school and life tasks, <br>
            and then falling asleep in the fragmented flow of information on the Internet. <br>
            Pretty boring, right?<br>

            It felt like I was creating another version of myself. <br>
            I was weaving all the good things that happened in my life into her life. <br>
            Every time I sent out a post or story, her life moved forward a little bit, <br>
            and other times it just stopped there, waiting to be updated.<br>
        </p>

    <div class="hidden-text"style="top: 2890px; right: 50px">

            I am not a person who updates very often, so I feel a little sorry for her.<br>

            People often avoid talking about themselves on the Internet, <br>
            saying that they should pay attention to privacy, and don't want to start an argument, <br>
            so they choose not to mention things about themselves. <br>
            But have you seen other people's memos? <br>
            Or those posts that are set to private mode? <br>
            I think that's where people get closer to who they really are.<br>
